## Pentesting Notebook

This notebook is for running queries directly against HeimdaLLM's parser and query
validator. It does not require a connection to an LLM. Use it to directly craft evil
queries that you believe may reveal unintentional information about the target database.

## Sakila Demo Database

The example notebooks above reference the Sakila Demo Database. It is useful to browse
this database directly to see what you're working with as you explore different queries.
You can browse the Sakila Demo Database in the IDE directly here:
