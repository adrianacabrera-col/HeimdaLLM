=============

There are two primary ways of using HeimdaLLM, depending on your unique circumstances.
The first is if you are doing the LLM integration yourself, and you only need to
validate the structured output. The second is if you want to use HeimdaLLM to create
a complete workflow to convert natural language to validated, structured output, via an
LLM.
