Is it safe to use?
******************
I am in the process of organizing an independent security audit of HeimdaLLM. Until this
audit is complete, I do not recommend using HeimdaLLM against any production system
without a careful risk assessment. These audits are self-funded, so please consider
`sponsoring me <https://github.com/sponsors/amoffat>`_ if you will get value from the
confidence that they will bring.

What databases are supported?
*****************************
Currently, sqlite's flavor of SQL is supported. There is rapid development for the other
top relational SQL databases. To help us prioritize, please `vote here
<https://github.com/amoffat/HeimdaLLM/discussions/2>`_ on which database you would like
to see supported:

Do I have to purchase a commercial license?
*******************************************
No, HeimdaLLM is dual-licensed and has an open source license, the `AGPLv3
<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html>`_. However, if you use the open source
license in your business, you must comply with the terms of the license, which can be
legally restricting and complicate your business operations. Most businesses prefer to
purchase a commercial license, which removes the restrictions, than to comply with the
terms of the AGPLv3.
