ðŸ§© Reconstruction
=================

A Bifrost is capable of reconstructing the structured output from an LLM. In the code
and docs, this is called "reconstruction" or "autofixing." Alghtough reconstruction is a
general HeimdaLLM concept, I will explain it concretely in the context of the SQL
Bifrost.

Rationale
*********

The goal of a :ref:`prompt envelope <bifrost-prompt-envelope>` is to
coax an LLM into producing a SQL query that has a high probability of being parsed and
validated correctly. Whatever we can do to facilitate a high success rate will result in
a better user experience. Otherwise, the user may see their input rejected due to
validation failures.

While developing the :class:`SQL Bifrost
<heimdallm.bifrosts.sql.sqlite.select.bifrost.SQLBifrost>` for HeimdaLLM, I noticed two
major sources of validation failures:

#. Queries with no ``LIMIT`` clause, or an incorrect ``LIMIT`` clause.
#. Queries that select columns that are forbidden.

This is not the fault of the LLM. It's unreliable and doesn't always do what you ask.
However, frequently failing validation is not a good user experience. To that end,
reconstruction was added to repair queries that have simple non-critical issues.

Reconstruction is enabled by default, but it can be disabled on a per-validation basis
by passing ``autofix=False`` to the :meth:`Bifrost.traverse
<heimdallm.bifrost.Bifrost.traverse>` method.
